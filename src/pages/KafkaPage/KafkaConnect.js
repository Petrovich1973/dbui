                <p>Kafka Connect, an open source component of Apache KafkaÂ®, is a framework for connecting Kafka with
                    external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems. Using Kafka
                    Connect, you can deploy connector implementations for common data sources and sinks to move data
                    into and out of Kafka.</p>
